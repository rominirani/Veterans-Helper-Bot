ABOUT
*****
Veterans Helper Bot is an Automated Google Talk Bot that will help Veterans through some of their common tasks.

This is my submission for the LinkedIn Veterans Hackday 2011.The bot is powered by APIs provided by National Resource Center APIs.

The bot currently does the following:

* Get Help Line Numbers
* Get Current Vet Jobs by keywords and in and around your location
* Look up details for any Military Operation Code (MOC)
* And in the future, much more.... all under one umbrella

Building the Project
********************
This is a Google App Engine project. You will need to import the project into your Eclipse Workspace and add the necessary App Engine JAR files.
